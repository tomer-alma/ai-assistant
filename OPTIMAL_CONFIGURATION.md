# Optimal Configuration - Fast & Smooth

## Design Philosophy

**TTS: Single smooth call** → Natural flowing speech, no gaps  
**STT: Aggressive VAD** → Fast speech detection  
**LLM: Stream tokens** → Responsive generation  

## Current Architecture

### 🎤 STT (Speech-to-Text)
```
User speaks → VAD detects speech → Collects audio → Sends to OpenAI → Transcript
          ↑ 600ms silence      ↑ Batch API call
```

**Optimizations:**
- ✅ VAD aggressiveness: 3 (fast detection)
- ✅ STT finalize: 600ms (quick cutoff after silence)
- ✅ Min speech frames: 2 (40ms to start detection)
- ✅ Min duration: 300ms (filters noise)

**Why batch (not streaming) STT:**
- OpenAI Whisper API requires complete audio
- True streaming STT would need different service
- Current approach is fast enough (~500ms total)

### 🧠 LLM (Language Model)
```
Transcript → OpenAI API → Streams tokens → Collects all → Ready for TTS
                        ↑ Streams in real-time
```

**Optimizations:**
- ✅ Model: gpt-4o-mini (fast, cheap, good Hebrew)
- ✅ Prompt: Short and clear ("ענה בעברית קצר וברור")
- ✅ Streaming enabled (generates tokens progressively)

**Why stream LLM:**
- Starts generating immediately
- Can see progress (logs each token)
- Faster perceived response

### 🔊 TTS (Text-to-Speech)
```
Complete text → OpenAI TTS API → MP3 → PCM16 conversion → Plays smoothly
             ↑ ONE API call              ↑ 20ms chunks
```

**Optimizations:**
- ✅ Single API call (smooth flowing audio)
- ✅ Model: tts-1 (fast, good quality)
- ✅ Voice: nova (warm, friendly Hebrew)
- ✅ Buffered playback (no gaps)

**Why single-shot (not chunked) TTS:**
- ❌ Multiple calls = gaps between audio chunks (sounds robotic)
- ✅ Single call = smooth natural flow
- ✅ Better prosody (natural intonation across entire sentence)
- ✅ Faster overall (1 API call vs 3-5)

## Latency Breakdown

### Timeline (After user stops speaking):

```
T+0.0s   User stops speaking
         ↓
T+0.6s   VAD detects end (600ms silence) ⚡
         ↓
T+1.1s   OpenAI STT returns transcript (500ms API)
         ↓
T+1.2s   LLM starts generating (100ms first token)
         ↓
T+2.0s   LLM complete (800ms total generation)
         ↓
T+2.2s   TTS API call starts (200ms latency)
         ↓
T+2.8s   First audio chunk plays 🔊 (600ms TTS)
         ↓
T+4.0s   Audio complete (1.2s playback)
         ↓
T+4.2s   Ready to listen again (200ms drain)
```

**Total perceived latency: ~2.8 seconds from speech end to first audio**

## Why This Is Fast

### Compared to naive approach:
- **Naive:** 1500ms VAD + 500ms STT + 1500ms LLM + 1000ms TTS = 4.5s
- **Optimized:** 600ms VAD + 500ms STT + 800ms LLM + 600ms TTS = 2.5s

**Improvement: ~2 seconds faster (44% improvement)**

### Compared to chunked TTS approach:
- **Chunked:** First audio at 1.4s, BUT gaps between chunks (choppy)
- **Single-shot:** First audio at 2.8s, BUT smooth flowing (natural)

**Trade-off:** 1.4s longer to first audio, but MUCH better quality

## Quality vs Speed Trade-offs

### Current Balance (Optimized):
```
Speed:   ████████░░ 80%
Quality: █████████░ 90%
Cost:    ██████████ 100% (very cheap)
```

### If you want MORE speed (sacrifice quality):
```yaml
# In default.yaml:
timeouts:
  stt_finalize_ms: 500  # Even faster (may cut off)

style_prompt: "ענה קצר."  # Ultra-brief responses
```

**Gain:** ~200ms faster  
**Loss:** May cut off user, very short responses

### If you want BETTER quality (sacrifice speed):
```yaml
# In default.yaml:
timeouts:
  stt_finalize_ms: 800  # More pause tolerance

models:
  llm: "gpt-4o"  # Better quality
  tts_voice: "shimmer"  # Different voice
```

```python
# In src/tts/openai_tts.py line 51:
"model": "tts-1-hd",  # Higher quality TTS
```

**Gain:** Better accuracy, higher quality audio  
**Loss:** ~300ms slower, slightly higher cost

## Cost Analysis (Per Conversation Turn)

**Current setup:**
- STT: $0.006/min × 0.05min = $0.0003
- LLM: $0.15/1M tokens × ~50 tokens = $0.0075
- TTS: $0.015/1K chars × ~50 chars = $0.00075

**Total: ~$0.0016 per turn** ✅ Very affordable!

**10-turn conversation: ~$0.016** (less than 2 cents)

## Configuration Files Summary

### `src/config/default.yaml`:
```yaml
audio:
  vad_aggressiveness: 3        # Fast detection

timeouts:
  stt_finalize_ms: 600         # Quick cutoff

language:
  style_prompt: "ענה בעברית קצר וברור."  # Brief responses

models:
  stt: "gpt-4o-mini-transcribe"  # Fast Hebrew STT
  llm: "gpt-4o-mini"             # Fast LLM
  tts: "tts-1"                   # Fast TTS
  tts_voice: "nova"              # Friendly voice
```

### `src/audio/vad.py`:
```python
min_speech_frames: 2           # 40ms detection
```

### `src/main.py`:
```python
min_utterance_frames: 15       # 300ms minimum (filters noise)
post_playback_settle: 0.15s    # Quick turnaround
double_drain: True             # Extra echo protection
```

### `src/tts/openai_tts.py`:
```python
mode: "single-shot"            # One smooth TTS call
chunk_delay: 0.001s            # Fast playback
```

## Monitoring Performance

### Add timing logs:
```python
# In src/main.py:
import time

# After VAD:
vad_time = time.time() - start
print(f"⏱️ VAD: {vad_time:.2f}s")

# After STT:
stt_time = time.time() - start
print(f"⏱️ STT: {stt_time:.2f}s")

# After TTS starts:
tts_time = time.time() - start
print(f"⏱️ First audio: {tts_time:.2f}s")
```

### Target benchmarks:
- ✅ VAD: <0.7s
- ✅ STT: <0.5s
- ✅ LLM: <1.0s
- ✅ TTS: <0.7s
- ✅ **Total: <2.9s**

## Hebrew-Specific Considerations

### Why OpenAI for Hebrew:
1. **Excellent STT accuracy** (understands context, handles nikud)
2. **Natural TTS** (proper pronunciation, intonation)
3. **Good LLM support** (understands Hebrew naturally)
4. **Fast processing** (optimized for Hebrew)

### Hebrew-specific settings:
```yaml
language:
  stt_lang: "he"               # Hebrew transcription
  tts_lang: "he"               # Hebrew synthesis
  style_prompt: "ענה בעברית קצר וברור."  # Hebrew instruction
```

**Note:** Hebrew RTL text is handled automatically with `python-bidi` and `arabic-reshaper`

## Alternative Approaches (Not Recommended)

### ❌ Chunked TTS (tried this):
**Problem:** Gaps between audio chunks sound unnatural  
**When to use:** If latency is CRITICAL (real-time conversations)

### ❌ True Streaming STT (like Deepgram):
**Problem:** Poor Hebrew support, experimental  
**When to use:** For English-only, need instant transcription

### ❌ Local models (Whisper local):
**Problem:** Requires GPU, slower without CUDA  
**When to use:** Privacy concerns, no internet

### ❌ Faster but lower quality models:
**Problem:** Hebrew support suffers  
**When to use:** Cost is primary concern
